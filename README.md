### Weather Prediction AI

## Overview

This repository was created to hold a project focused on long-term weather prediction. 
The primary goalis to develop a fully AI based NWP model capable of forecasting up to
three months out from initialization. This project aims to create an end-to-end pipeline
for AI-driven weather forecasting. The main approach to this is to have an AI that can
gather, process, and prepare its own datasets to train itself on.
